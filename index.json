In this study, we conduct a survey of small seismic events from 1 May 2017 to 25 April 2018 near North Korea’s nuclear test site. We report 88 seismic events, including the 2017 nuclear test, the collapse event 8.5 min later, and 86 earthquakes afterward. Among the 86 earthquakes, 11 are well constrained to be distributed along a near north–south direction within a region of 2 km, ∼8.4 km north of the test site. The null detection before the 2017 test and the intense seismicity after the test, along with the predicted normal tensile stress the 2017 test applied on the fault, provide strong evidence that the 2017 test triggered these earthquakes. Some characteristics (the distance to the nuclear test center, depth, and magnitude) of these triggered aftershocks fit the general characteristics of the aftershocks in the Nevada National Security Site and the Semipalatinsk test site after nuclear tests, but the aftershocks of North Korea’s 2017 test exhibit a different evolution lasting at least eight months with two bursts occurring on early December 2017 and early February 2018 and an otherwise general low occurrence rate, possibly caused by a different geological setting of the test site.","tags":[],"title":"Triggered seismicity after North Korea’s 3 September 2017 nuclear test","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Jiayuan Yao**","Dongdong Tian","Li Sun","Lianxing Wen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1537804800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1537804800,"objectID":"597a5c9aca358f946c833875e7a31b04","permalink":"https://core-man.github.io/academic-homepage/publication/2018-yao-srl-a/","publishdate":"2018-09-25T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/academic-homepage/publication/2018-yao-srl-a/","section":"publication","summary":"By using an on‐site collapse event as a reference and eliminating path effects of seismic‐wave propagation, we constrain source characteristics of North Korea’s 3 September 2017 nuclear test. In the framework of a complete source model for an underground explosion consisting of an isotropic source representing the explosion and two secondary sources accompanying the explosion, with one represented by a double couple (DC) attributed to tectonic release and the other an oblique compensated linear vector dipole (CLVD) attributed to source medium damage, the source model of the 2017 test is inferred from its noncircular radiation patterns of Rayleigh and Love waves using seismic observations of the collapse as references. Based on the opposite azimuths of the inferred oblique CLVD of the test and the collapsing force of the event 8.5 min later, we propose a deformation scenario of the 2017 test in that the test generates a prompt source medium damage expanding away from the test center mostly along the direction of 320° (represented by the oblique CLVD) and the deformed surrounding rocks collapse toward the test center along the weakness direction in an opposite way 8.5 min later (represented by the collapse). We further propose that an inferred obliqueness of CLVD accompanying a nuclear test may serve an indication of possible collapsing direction for the test. Because the surface‐wave magnitude is strongly contaminated by secondary sources, we estimate the yield of the 2017 test to be 109.4±48.6kt based on the body‐wave Lg magnitude.","tags":[],"title":"Source characteristics of North Korea’s 3 September 2017 nuclear test","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The core-mantle boundary (CMB) is one of the most important interfaces in the Earth’s interior and plays a key role in the geodynamical evolution of the planet.

The interior of the Earth’s inner core exhibits both velocity and attenuation anisotropy, and hemispherical variations of velocity, attenuation and anisotropy, while the surface of the inner core possesses topography and mushy zone in some localized regions. The inner core velocity and attenuation anisotropy is cylindrical with the axis of high velocity and high attenuation parallel with the Earth’s rotation axis, and depth dependent with the topmost 100–400 km close to be isotropic and the innermost 300–600 km possibly possessing a distinct anisotropy. The hemispherical variations in the inner core are manifested in many aspects: the isotropic velocity of the topmost ~100 km of the eastern hemisphere is 0.8% faster than that of the western hemisphere, the attenuation in the top ~100 km of the eastern hemisphere (Q=250) is stronger than that of the western hemisphere (Q=600), the top isotropic layer is thinner in the western hemisphere (~100 km) than in the eastern hemisphere (~400 km), and the inner core anisotropy in the western hemisphere (~4%) is stronger than in the eastern hemisphere (~0.7%). In the boundary, the inner core exhibits topographic variations with height changes of 1–14 km beneath the Philippine Sea, the Yellow Sea, the western Pacific and Central America, and a mushy zone with a thickness of 4–8 km beneath the southwest Okhotsk Sea. These new findings have motivated a series of new physical mechanisms in the scientific community and demand for reevaluation of outer core composition, thermal-compositional convection in the outer core, inner core solidification process and driving force of Earth’s geodynamo. These results suggest that the inner core solidification process and the driving force of Earth’s geodynamo are not laterally homogeneous, as it has long been held in the traditional views. Solidification may occur in the western hemisphere releasing latent heat and light elements, while melting may occur in the eastern hemisphere absorbing latent heat and light elements. Therefore, the driving forces for the outer core convection in these two hemispheres may be different and may even be in opposite signs. Such alternative solidification and melting should also occur in the localized topographic regions. Moreover, the solidification in the region of a mushy zone would release both thermal and chemical energy, while that in other regions of a sharp inner core boundary only releases thermal energy.","tags":[],"title":"Seismic structure and dynamic process of the Earth's inner core and its boundary","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"  May 21, 2019: The paper on Temporal change of seismic Earth\u0026rsquo;s inner core phases: inner core differential rotation or temporal change of inner core surface? has been accepted at JGR.\n  Sep. 20, 2018: The paper on source characteristics of North Korea\u0026rsquo;s 2017 nuclear test has been published online at SRL.\n  Sep. 20, 2018: The paper on triggerred seismicity after North Korea\u0026rsquo;s 2017 nuclear test has been published online at SRL.\n  Aug. 1, 2018: Jiayuan Yao commenced to work as a research fellow at the School of Physical \u0026amp; Mathematical Sciences at Nanyang Technological University.\n  Jun. 21, 2018: Jiayuan Yao has been admitted to the degree of Doctor of Natural Science in Geophysics.\n  May 28, 2018: Jiayuan Yao has sucessfully defended his Ph.D. thesis.\n  Mar. 12, 2018: Jiayuan Yao is awarded the Outstanding Graduate Student Award from University of Science and Technology of China, and the Outstanding Graduate Students with Good Conduct in Anhui Province.\n  ","date":1515369600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1533081600,"objectID":"a0812ae5f3c926fea6faf4472cefc8e2","permalink":"https://core-man.github.io/academic-homepage/news/","publishdate":"2018-01-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/academic-homepage/news/","section":"","summary":"May 21, 2019: The paper on Temporal change of seismic Earth\u0026rsquo;s inner core phases: inner core differential rotation or temporal change of inner core surface? has been accepted at JGR.","tags":null,"title":"News","type":"page"},{"authors":["**Jiayuan Yao**","Li Sun","Lianxing Wen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1438444800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1438444800,"objectID":"940b7201fe4f695bc46d736e8918cc7d","permalink":"https://core-man.github.io/academic-homepage/publication/2015-yao-jgr/","publishdate":"2015-08-02T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/academic-homepage/publication/2015-yao-jgr/","section":"publication","summary":"We report two decades of changing behavior of the Earth's inner core boundary (ICB), which provides the simplest explanation for the observed temporal change of the compressional seismic waves that are reflected from the ICB (PKiKP) and refracted in the inner core (PKIKP), from earthquake doublets occurring in South Sandwich Islands between 1993 and 2013. In the early period (before 2003), the ICB is enlarged beneath the western coast of Gabon, Republic of Congo, and southwest Tanzania in the reflected points of the PKiKP observed at seismic stations OBN, AAK, and ARU, while it experiences little change beneath Zimbabwe or/and Kenya, and beneath west Angola or/and north Central African Republic, in the PKIKP entry or/and exit points of AAK and ARU observations, respectively. In the later period (after 1998), the ICB regions beneath the western coast of Gabon, Republic of Congo, and southwest Tanzania either shrink or remain unchanged, and the temporal change migrates to beneath Zimbabwe or/and Kenya, and beneath west Angola or/and north Central African Republic, with a decrease of inner core surface by 5.59 km between 1998 and 2009 beneath Zimbabwe or Kenya and by 1.73 km beneath west Angola or north Central African Republic between 1998 and 2013. These results indicate that ICB temporal change occurs in localized regions and is episodic, rapidly migrating, and alternately enlarged and shrunk.","tags":[],"title":"Two decades of temporal change of Earth's inner core boundary","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Jiayuan Yao**","Lianxing Wen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1400601600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1400601600,"objectID":"0a31c3b33f08fae7a1974177a77ac288","permalink":"https://core-man.github.io/academic-homepage/publication/2014-yao-pepi/","publishdate":"2014-05-21T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/academic-homepage/publication/2014-yao-pepi/","section":"publication","summary":"We constrain seismic structure and ultra-low velocity zones near the Earth’s core-mantle boundary (CMB) beneath Southeast Asia. We first determine the average shear-velocity structure near the CMB in the region based on travel-time analysis of S, ScS, P and ScP phases. We then map seismic scattering in the lowermost mantle using the PKP precursors observed at the USArray. The inferred average shear-velocity perturbations in the lowermost 200 km of the mantle range from about −6% to 6%, and exhibit a complex geographic distribution of alternate low- and high-velocity patches adjacent to each other, surrounded by a high-velocity anomaly in the south. The inferred strong seismic scatterers exhibit a crescent shape distributed from the South China Sea to the Maluku Islands and coincide with the westernmost low-velocity patch, suggesting that the strong scatterers represent ultra-low velocity zones (ULVZs). We suggest that the seismic structure in the region likely results from a complex interaction between a downwelling and a low-velocity region near the CMB. The downwelling (the high-velocity patches) displaces the low-velocity region into many low-velocity patches and pushes the ULVZs to the edge of the low-velocity region.","tags":[],"title":"Seismic structure and ultra-low velocity zones at the base of the Earth’s mantle beneath Southeast Asia","type":"publication"}]
